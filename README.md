# cart_pole

Hi everybody, we are Giacomo Ettore Rocco, and Riccardo Zulla. This is just a small application and implementation of the DQN in Python on the gymnasium cart-pole environment. 
At the moment, it works fine and successfully completes the task in less than 100 episodes.

Being that this is just an exercise, we do not save the weights of the neural networks. If you want to see the episodes and the cart pole in action, simply set the render mode to "human". 
If you're more interested in observing the performance, there is a commented part that plots the results.

Feel free to contact us for any reason. We appreciate your feedback and suggestions. Enjoy exploring the code!
